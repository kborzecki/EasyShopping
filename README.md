# EasyShopping

EasyShopping is a simple Android app created as a university project for Java classes.
The main feature of this app is creating a shopping list from recipes stored on a server.

## Disclaimer

I developed this app together with [mciezczak312](https://github.com/mciezczak312).

[Lagger96's](https://github.com/Lagger96) commits are my own - for some reason I was using that account for this project.
